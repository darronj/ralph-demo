# Ralph Wiggum Loop Prompt

You are working on a feature using the Ralph Wiggum Loop.

## Your Task

1. **Read the PRD carefully** - Review all requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Choose ONE incomplete requirement** - Pick any unchecked requirement (not necessarily the first one)
3. **Fully implement that requirement** - Write all necessary code, tests, and documentation
4. **Update the PRD file** - Check off the completed requirement (change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`)
5. **Append summary to ./progress.txt** - Write one line to the root-level progress.txt file with this format:
   ```
   [YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS] Feature: <feature-path> - Completed: <brief requirement summary>
   ```

## After Completing These Steps

Respond with exactly one of:
- `CONTINUE` - if more requirements remain unchecked
- `COMPLETE` - if ALL requirements and acceptance criteria are now checked off
- `STUCK: <reason>` - if you cannot proceed

## Critical Requirements

- **Actually implement** - Don't just plan or describe, write production-ready code
- **Update the PRD** - The requirement must be checked off in the file
- **Write to progress.txt** - Root level (./progress.txt), not the feature's progress.md
- **Be thorough** - The requirement should be complete and tested
- **Check acceptance criteria** - Ensure your implementation meets both feature-specific and standard criteria

## Notes

- You can choose which requirement to work on based on logical dependencies or complexity
- Each iteration should complete exactly ONE requirement fully
- The PRD file path and feature path will be provided in the context below
